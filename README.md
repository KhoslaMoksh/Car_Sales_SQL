# Car Sales SQL Project
## Project Overview

This project focuses on performing data analysis on a dataset containing car sales over several months. The goal is to answer several key business questions related to car sales, prices, and trends. The project demonstrates my ability to apply SQL for data cleaning, manipulation, and performing complex queries to extract valuable insights.

Key Questions Explored
The analysis is segmented into the following key questions, each representing a SQL query for data exploration:

#### Q1 - What are the sales of cars in each state?
#### Q2 - Which kind of car is most popular? How many sales are made for each make and model?
#### Q3 - Are there any differences in sales prices in different states? What's the average sales price in each state?
#### Q4 - What's the average monthly sales price for a car sold?
#### Q5 - Which month of the year has the most sales?
#### Q6 - What are the top 5 selling vehicles for each body type?
#### Q7 - Which sales are higher than the average for that car's model, and how much higher are they?
#### Q8 - What is the impact of car condition on the sale price?
#### Q9 - How does the odometer value impact the sale price?
#### Q10 - What is each brand's highest, lowest, and average selling price, and how many different models are sold?

SQL Queries and Techniques Used
This project includes various SQL queries and techniques, such as:

Data Cleaning: Removing duplicates, handling null values, and correcting data inconsistencies. <br>
Data Manipulation: Aggregating data, filtering, and grouping by relevant fields. <br>
Complex Queries: Using JOIN, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, and subqueries to extract meaningful insights. <br>
Aggregate Functions: Calculating averages, sums, counts, and other aggregate metrics. <br>
The queries are segmented and explained using comments in the SQL file to match the key business questions. <br>

Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis contains car sales data across multiple months, including car models, prices, sale dates, condition, and more. This data was used to answer key questions related to sales trends, pricing, and vehicle conditions.

This project demonstrates my ability to write advanced SQL queries, clean and manipulate data, and derive actionable insights from complex datasets.
