# Car Sales SQL project

This project is about performing data analysis on a set of data to answer some questions.
The dataset (Link mentioned above) is on car sales over several months.

In this, I demonstrated various queries for data cleaning, data manipulation etc.
The questions and questions are segmented using the comments in the SQL file.

Q1 = What are the sales of cars in each state?<br>
Q2 = Which kind of car is most popular? How many sales are made for each make and model?<br>
Q3 = Are there any differences in sales prices in different states? What's the average sales price in each state?<br>
Q4 = What's the average monthly sales price for a car sold?<br>
Q5 = Which month of the year has the most sales?<br>
Q6 = What are the top 5 selling vehicles for each body type?<br>
Q7 = Which sales are higher than the average for that car's model, and how much higher are they?<br>
Q8 = What is the impact of car condition on the sale price?<br>
Q9 = How does the odometer value impact the sale price?<br>
Q10 = What is the highest, lowest, and average selling price for each brand, and how many different models are sold?<br>
